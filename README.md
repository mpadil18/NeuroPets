# NeuroPets

## Requirements

Being a mobile app, there is no installation neccessary
for using neuropets.net, all that is required for use is
a functioning email and a device to access the site url.

Note for mobile users: if desired to use as an app, access the 
site in your native browser, and add nueropets to your homepage.

## Using the App

On the app, users must first register with a valid email
and password before having access to the rest of the features.
Once logged in, new users will then be prompted after an intro
to create a goal or challenge to practice for the next 60 days.
After a goal is set, the homepage will allow access to the rest 
of the features of our project, with a navigation bar for goal
changes, goal logs, and a pet store placed at the bottom, as well
as a log out button for when the user completed their task.  

## Features

Our main feature is our goal tracking capabilities, with
the ability to create, log the progress of, and follow through
with the goals a user would aim to accomplish in 60 days.
Coupled with the goal tracing, our app also gives the user a pet
who is tied to your goal, and evolves as your progress does.
Pets can be interacted with in a variety of ways, and can even 
be dressed up in accessories or placed in new habitats using
points recieved from completing your goals in the pet store.
Users can also change or cancel their goals on the home screen
if they choose, and any goals, completed or deleted, can be viewed
in the goal logs on the navigation screen, along with the pets
attached to the goals and their progress as well.
