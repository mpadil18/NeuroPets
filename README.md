Being a mobile web app, there is no installation neccessary
for using neuropets.net, all that is required for use is
a functioning email and a device to access the site url.

native browser, and add nueropets to your homepage using the share button.

## Using the App

### Registering and Logging In
On the login page, new users must first register with a valid email
and password before having access to the rest of the features.
Returning users can input their logged email and password to continue.

### Creating a Goal
Once logged in, new users will then be prompted after an intro
to create a goal to practice for the next 60 days. Preset goals
are also offered, which display a different challenge each day.
Users who complete, change, or cancel their goal will return here.

### Navigating the Homepage
After a goal is set, the homepage will allow access to the rest of
the features of the app. At the top displays the users current goal,
or a random challenge is a preset goal was chosen. In the center is
where your pet is displayed with your progress and points above them,
as well as the goal logging button. And on the bottom is a navigation 
bar with four buttons: the first is designated for changing the user's 
goal, the next is for goal logs that are tracked each day, next is a 
store placed for purchasing cosmetics, and a log out button for when 
the user chooses to exit the app.  

## Features

### Goal Tracking
Our main feature is our goal tracking capabilities, with
the ability to create, log the progress of, and follow through
with the goals a user would aim to accomplish in 60 days.

### Pet Evolution
Coupled with the goal tracing, our app also gives the user a pet
who is tied to your goal, who is initially hidden inside of an egg.
They then hatch into one of a number of animals, who evolves in 
multiple stages as you make progress on your goal.

### Pet Accessories
Pets can be dressed up with in a variety of ways, who can wear
a vaiety of hats and clothing purchased from the pet store
using points recieved from completing your goals each day.

### Goal Changing and viewing Goal Logs
Users can also change or cancel their goals on the home screen
if they choose, and any goals, completed or deleted, can be viewed
in the goal logs on the navigation screen, along with the pets
attached to the goals who you raised along the way.
